# The current layout and layers
1. Remap held down event for spacebar, `space` -> `shfit`, since I realise that 
   the bad experience of typing symbols on nubmers mainly cause by the difficult 
   combination of left right shfit and numbers, it is better to alter thumbs 
   instead of pinky figer to press `shfit`.

2. move the reamin symbols to the location closer to the main area of the 
   kyboard. They are `=` `+` `~`  `\` `|` `"` `'` `-` `\_` `=` `[` `]` `{` `}`.
Use trivial solution for symbols and numbers, reduce the unnecessary layers 
using.

3. Map `left shfit` as tap-held keys, tap as `escape`, held down as `control`.

4. Add number pad layer for convenient calculation, active key is the `fn` keys 

Current layout:
base layer
![base layer](main/img/curretBaseLayer.png?raw=true)
symbol layer:
![symbol layer](main/img/currentSymbollayer.png?raw=true)
